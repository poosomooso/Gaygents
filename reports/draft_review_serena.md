# Draft Review
### [Self-Organized Critical Properties of Earthquakes through Cellular Automata-based Models](https://github.com/mpbrucker/ComplexityProject2/blob/master/reports/draft_final_report.md)

The original problem and model is really well explained. However, in your power law section, you never tell us what m is. Also, a nit picky thing, but even though markdown doesn't do subscripts, I think html can, and you can just embed html code into markdown.

This is more like a stretch goal, but if you have ample free time, consider making an illustration of how it works. Though I'm guessing your free time is not ample.

For Figure 1, it is probably useful to explicitly point out that the graph on the right is the paper's in the caption.

2 small typos: 1) In the paragraph under figure 1 should probably not say "This fits with the findings of Olami et al.: as can be seen in Figure 2"; I'm assuming you mean the right figure of figure 1. 2) Figure 2 and 3 and 4's captions aren't on a separate line from the actual figures.

Does the paper have a similar graph to fig. 2? I want to see the difference.

What is exponent B?

I'm confused by this line at the end of your replication section : "However, regardless, our model still indicates that the system follows a power-law distribution, which can be seen quantitatively in Figure 2 and qualitatively in Figure 1." Didn't you just say that your Figure 2 isn't similar to the paper? What do you mean by this?

Jumping ahead, your stuff on pink noise seems reasonable to me. I wasn't really sure how you calculated the fractal dimension, since y'all just say "counting the number of cells that fall into each "bin."" What is a bin? It also seems a bit strange that you are using the final set of forces, which doesn't tell me much besides energy lost. Maybe it's worth trying box counting but with measuring other things, like the number of forces transferred across edges, or some way of average forces in the cells over the simulation period. Or how long it takes for the simulation to reach steady-state.

Overall this is really well written, aside from a few missing keywords and the stuff on fractal dimension. And y'all seem like your in a good place.
