###### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

Replication: Do earthquake systems exhibit self-organized criticality resulting in a power law distribution (specifically the Gutenberg-Richter law)?
Extension: Is self-organized criticality still present in earthquake systems when there is no conservation of energy?

###### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

A 2d cellular automata with springs between cells is what I think is happening. It makes a lot of sense. The three phases are also clearly explained. Maybe a visualization of the CA or a simplified version of this for each step would be helpful?

###### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Figure 1 doesn't explain the right graph (I'm assuming that was the original experiment). I'm not sure what alpha is. It would also help if the graphs were scaled the same.

###### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The explanation makes sense, but it might be useful to reiterate in the interpretation how SOC is related to a power law and maybe use that to transition into the pink noise and fractal geometry sections.

###### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the

The results appear consistent, and the discrepancies are explained.

###### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The extension (using a different model to see if the results hold) makes sense. It was a little confusing at first, but that was because I was expecting a separate replication and extension. It is clear, and attempts to answer an interesting question that the previous conservative model could not.

###### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Progress looks good!

###### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Overall, it is consistent with the style guide. However, it is wordy at times.

###### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

Looks good!
